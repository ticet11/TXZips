# TX Zips - CSV to JSON

Just a quick script I put together to take all the Texas zip codes out of a csv file of US zip codes and put them in a JSON file. That's what it was, anyway. Then, I needed to get more data from other sources and less data from original sources and now this has done a lot. The ultimate goal is what you see in the tx.json file, a dict of zip codes, which all have a city, county, population, and list of ip address ranges.
