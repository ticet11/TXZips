# TX Zips - CSV to JSON

Just a quick script I put together to take all the Texas zip codes out of a csv file of US zip codes and put them in a JSON file.

Original csv file obtained from [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips), which uses a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Original csv has not been altered.
